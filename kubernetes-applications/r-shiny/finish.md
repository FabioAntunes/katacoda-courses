![R Shiny](/javajon/courses/kubernetes-applications/r-shiny/assets/shiny.png "Interact. Analyze. Communicate.")

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned:

- &#x2714; how to use the basics of the kubectl CLI tool,
- &#x2714; how to install Shiny applications on Kubernetes,
- &#x2714; how containers are deployed as Deployments in Pods,
- &#x2714; how a Service can provide access to a replication of Pods.

Use this same technique to create your own containers containing your own Shiny solutions.
