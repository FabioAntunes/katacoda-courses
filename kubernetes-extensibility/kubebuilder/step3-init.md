Kubebuild has an init command that creates a local directory populated with the skelton to start writing your Operator.

`kubebuilder init --domain d2iq.com --owner "learner"`{{execute}}

The directory created in `learner` and we leave the domain arbitrarily at `d2iq.com` to pay homage to [**Ken Sipe**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kensipe/) for the origin material of this scenario.
