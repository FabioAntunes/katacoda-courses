Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator (KUDO) provides a declarative approach to building production-grade Kubernetes Operators covering the entire application lifecycle. 

## Operator Pattern
If you find yourself needing to manage specialize services and solution sets on Kubernetes, often writing an Operator provides management solutions to manage these complexities. Operator container imperative management logic that react to declarative requests and asychronous Kubernetes events. More about the [Operator Pattern can be found here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/). There are a variety of projects that offer you development solutions for writing Operators. KUDO is a prominent solution for writing Operators. The scenario teaches you how to use it.

## About KUDO

KUDO is an open source Apache 2.0 project governed by the good people at D2IQ. KUDO is a much easier way to write an Operator as it embraces a declarative form over an imperative Go based controller. The KUDO project is built using the Kubebuilder project.

In this scenario you will hand craft a Operator, create an Operator repository and install the Operator to your Kubernetes cluster.

This is a step-by-step walk through of the creation of an operator using the KUDO CLI to generate the KUDO operator structure.
