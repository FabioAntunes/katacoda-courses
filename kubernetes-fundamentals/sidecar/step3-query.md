Once available, you can exercise the service two ways. First, simply from the command line,

`curl https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-31112-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com`{{execute}}

the same UI for `sidecar-pod` can also be seen in your browser from the "sidecar-pod" tab above the command line area or from this link: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-31112-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

As an alternative to the kubectl CLI you can also observe both deployments in the [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/) by clicking on the tab above this command line or from this link: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com
