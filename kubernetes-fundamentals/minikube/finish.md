# Conclusion #

Minikube runs locally on your laptop for free and is a great way to learn and experiment with Kubernetes. While it's just a single node solution, Minikube provides much of the same experiences found on larger multi-node clusters.

Now that you understand Minikube, you are ready to start exploring Kubernetes.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned:

- &#x2714; about Minikube installation,
- &#x2714; about Minikube configuration,
- &#x2714; how Minikube CLI tool differs from the Kubernetes KubeCtl tool,
- &#x2714; about various cluster inspection techniques,
- &#x2714; about the conveniences Minikube addons.
