# Conclusion #

While there are numerous, complimenting and competing ways to implement your CI/CD flows, you may be overwhelmed with [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) while trying to invest in the best choice. Consider Tekton is helping to standardize on the language and architecture of pipelines that leverage the existing [benefits of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/#why-you-need-kubernetes-and-what-can-it-do).

This tutorial shows how you can easily use Kubernetes as the underlying platform for running Tekton based Pipelines. CI/CD is a great place for your team to start understanding how to leverage the distributed and high availability nature of Kubernetes.
