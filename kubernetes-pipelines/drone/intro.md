[Drone](https://www.drone.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/drone/drone) Continuous Delivery platform. A CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying containers. 

## Configuration as Code ##

Pipelines are configured with a simple, easy‑to‑read file that you commit to your git repository. Each Pipeline step is executed inside an isolated Docker container that is automatically downloaded at runtime.

## Any Source Code Manager ##

Drone integrates seamlessly with multiple source code management systems, including GitHub, GitHubEnterprise, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

## Any Platform ##

Drone natively supports multiple operating systems and architectures, including Linux x64, ARM, ARM64 and Windows x64.

## Any Language ##

Drone works with any language, database or service that runs inside a Docker container. Choose from thousands of public Docker images or provide your own.

You will learn how:

- Write a drone file
- Install and interact with the command line tool (CLI)
- Install Drone engine on Kubernetes
- Run a full pipeline
